My Tech Talk Proposals

This is my collection of tech talk proposals for conferences like RailsConf, RubyConf, etc. I'm publishing them here so that this process is a little less opaque for people trying to get started.  Each proposal follows the same basic structure:

```
---
author: Michael Kelly <michaelkelly322@gmail.com>
conf:   RailsConf 2018
track:  Business and Rails
result: <rejected | accepted and when presented>
---

# <Title>

## Abstract

## Details

## Pitch
```

This structure is largely based on the requirements for the RailsConf proposal process, but should translate pretty well to other conference formats if necessary.
