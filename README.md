My Tech Talk Proposals

This is my collection of tech talk proposals for conferences like RailsConf, RubyConf, etc. I'm publishing them here so that this process is a little less opaque for people trying to get started.  Each proposal follows the same basic structure:

```
---
target: <Target audience for the talk>
slides: <link to slideshare slides>
presented:
  - RailsConf 2015
---

# <Title>

## Abstract

## Details

## Pitch
```

This structure is largely based on the requirements for the RailsConf proposal process, but should translate pretty well to other conference formats if necessary.
