# Good Enough Software

## Abstract

Solving complex problems is a delicate balance of trade-offs and compromises. Many projects have languished because of a pursuit of perfection.  This is particularly true of developers who want to launch their own side-projects. In this talk, we’ll discuss where the lines are in the sand and how engineers/entrepreneurs can identify and ship “good enough” software and keep projects alive and in front of users.

## Details

- Introduction and Expectations
  - Who is this talk for
  - Why we need to know what's "good enough"
- The nature of software systems
  - No truly perfect system
  - Bugs/refinements/enhancements are why engineers exist
  - This is compounded in startup or single-developer environments
- What is "Good Enough"?
  - Contexts (good enough for _what_?)
    - Dependent on users and field
    - Startups
    - Established Engineering teams
  - Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas:
    - "Make quality a requirements issue"
    - Know when to ship
- How do we get better?
  - Iterate and Make acceptability part of your iteration
    - Define good enough for the immediate need
    - Ship it
    - Learn from it
    - GoTo top
- Real examples of doing it right
  - Arcade
- Real examples of doing it wrong
  - ACK Foundry

## Pitch

As engineers, we’re constantly having to solve problems with complex inputs without clearly “best” approaches.  No software system is ever going to be “perfect” and every new product will be rough when it launches.  These are facts of our world that we can’t get around.  We can however hone our skill in identifying what makes software “good enough.”
